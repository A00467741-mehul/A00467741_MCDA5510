In the weekends, all of us likes to hang out with our families and hence we all go to see movies in theatres and everyone just loves it and had a wonderful time.

One interesting fact about me is that, when I go to watch movies with my friends who likes to watch romantic movie, I often goes to sleep and later when they discuss about the movie, I donâ€™t have any clue what to discuss.
